\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Multi-processors are widely used in embedded systems. The resource limitation requires designers to find optimizations among various design considerations. In this paper, we model tradeoffs between makespan and the balance of processor workloads for the problem of tasks mapping and scheduling in a multi-processor environment. To encode the effect of precedence relations between different tasks in scheduling, the model also considers communication cost in the formulation. Furthermore, to approximate the Pareto front of the multi-objective optimization problem, we propose a multi-objective hybrid algorithm(MOHA) by integrating pareto local search into an evolutionary process. We evaluate the efficiency of the method on a series of benchmarks and compare the results with existing multi-objective optimization methods. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain better solutions for various real-world cases, compared with state-of-the-art methods.

\section{Conclusion and future work\label{se:con}}
To meet increasing requirements on  high  system performance and low power consumption, we have proposed two optimization objectives, i.e., makespan minimisation and workload balance, for mapping and scheduling problem of MPSoCs. The model for optimization encapsulates task scheduling, with the consideration of both computation and communication cost. To deal with the optimization of large scale applications, we have also proposed a multi-objective hybrid algorithm. Compared from the generated solutions, our algorithm outperforms  methods such as CPLEX and NSGAII.  
For the future work, we will refine the model to encompass more objectives to be optimized, as well as extending the current algorithm from two to more objectives optimization.
